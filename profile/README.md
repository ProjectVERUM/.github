## VERUM

In the aviation sector, and particularly within Urban Air Mobility (UAM), the trustworthiness, reliability, and certifiability of AI-based environment-perception systems remain significant unresolved challenges. The **VERUM** (**VER**trauenswürdige **UM**felderkennung) project addresses these issues by developing a reference architecture for trustworthy environment perception tailored to UAM applications. 

At the core of this architecture is **Radix**, a semantic occupancy-grid mapping approach that is made available as open-source software through this organization page.

VERUM was a collaborative project of the *Fraunhofer Application Center "Networked Mobility and Infrastructure"*, *HENSOLDT Analytics GmbH*, and *Ancud IT-Beratung GmbH*, funded by the *Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy* between 2023 and 2025.
